## INTRODUCTION
This project analyzes a supermarket sales dataset containing detailed information on customer transactions across multiple branches. The aim is to identify sales trends, understand customer purchasing behavior, and evaluate overall business performance. Using Power BI, the data was cleaned, transformed, and visualized through interactive dashboards. These dashboards highlight sales trends across branches, top-performing product lines, customer preferences, and payment patterns. The insights gained from this analysis provide a clear understanding of what drives revenue and customer satisfaction, supporting data-driven decision-making for future growth.

## OBJECTIVES 
The objectives of this project are:
1.  To analyze overall sales performance across different product categories, cities, and branches to identify key revenue drivers.
2.  To evaluate customer distribution and purchasing behavior based on customer type, gender, and payment method.
3.  To monitor monthly sales trends in order to identify peak and low-performing periods.
 4. To assess product category performance by comparing total sales and average unit prices across cities.
5.  To measure customer engagement and satisfaction levels through the average rating metric.
6. To understand branch-level performance and how customer type influences sales within each branch.
7.  To identify actionable insights that can guide business strategies, improve sales efficiency, and enhance customer experience
